# Kelvin
Kelvin is document oriented database written in pure Go.

## Motivation && Reasons
Go has generic support with current versions. \
I want to see if a useful document oriented database can be written for Go using generic types. \
Therefore, this repository contains some experimentation. \
If a good implementation comes out, I hope this repository will allow Go developers to have a tool like [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) or [LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB).

## Design Principles
- As efficient and performant as possible
- Take care to keep type safety
- Implement Kelvin as readable && elegant
- Follow ACID principles
- Provide thread-safety
- No 3rd-party dependencies
